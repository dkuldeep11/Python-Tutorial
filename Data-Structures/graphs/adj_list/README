This is a graph data structure represented in Adjacency List format

Vertex
    
    class Vertex
     |  This is the class of Vertx for a graph
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, value=None)
     |      This is constructor:
     |      class has 2 attributes- 1) id 2) connections dict i.e. vertex->weight
     |  
     |  addNeighbour(self, nbr, wt=0)
     |  
     |  getConnections(self)
     |  
     |  getId(self)
     |  
     |  getWeight(self, nbr)


Graph
    
    class Graph
     |  This is Graph class
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self)
     |  
     |  addEdge(self, u, v, c=0)
     |  
     |  addVertex(self, v)
     |  
     |  getVertex(self, k)
     |  
     |  getVertices(self)
     |  
     |  show(self)
